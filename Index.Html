                <h1>ABOUT ME <img src="Images/favicon-32x32.png" class="bee"> </h1>
                <h8>Hi! I'm Jess, an Independant Consultant with The Body Shop at Home. I started this journey in 2020
                    to help others
                    and keep myself occupied during Covid. I loved the products after a friend bought me some for
                    Christmas and started
                    purchasing from a Body Shop at Home consultant. She asked me whether I wanted to start a family and
                    friends account
                    and that's how Bee Harmony was born. After a while, customers asked about candles and wax melts as
                    well. I went to
                    a candle party last year and loved the principles, ethics and local small business of Matty's
                    candles and asked to
                    add them to my portfolio. Fast forward to the end of 2022 and I've re-launched Bee Harmony as The
                    Three B's. Firstly,
                    once I launched Bee Harmony, it sounded too much like EHarmony - eek! It did however show a love of
                    products with
                    yourself though. The Three B's I chose for a number of reasons - firstly my school nickname was Jess
                    Bee but then
                    I liked the idea that this could support a relaxing experience at home for your body and mind,
                    through beauty and
                    bath products.
                    <br>
                    I would love to help in any way I can, whether it is something for you, a loved one or a precious
                    gift. I can help
                    pick the perfect item, wrap it and deliver at as well. I can help as much or as little as you would
                    like, with no
                    pressure at all. <br>Have a great day! Jess</h8>
